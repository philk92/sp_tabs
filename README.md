# startpage
Start page for your browser that searches duckduckgo and has an animated sun/moon depending on the time of day.

At the moment everything is hard-coded, I may add some updates to pull bookmarks from a JSON and be able to add/remove bookmarks from the interface itself...but as of now this suffices for what I need.

Pull requests are always welcome, take it and make it your own :)
